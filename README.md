This is a Todo application built using react-native for mobile and web

NOTE: Due my system (personal laptop) limitations, I am not able to test my code for mobile devices.

-- completed the given task as per the requirements given the documentation.
-- even though i am not able to test the mobile code in my system, i have written code for both web and mobile. and i hope that the mobile code will also run, if we run the code in android studio or xcode

how to run the app?

1. clone the repo
2. install node_modules
3. run yarn start for web
